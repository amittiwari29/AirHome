## Endpoints

### Auth
- `POST /auth/register` — body `{email, password, full_name, is_host}` -> `{token, user}`
- `POST /auth/login` — body `{email, password}` -> `{token, user}`
- `GET /auth/me` — auth required -> `user`

### Amenities
- `GET /amenities` -> `[{id, name, icon}]`

### Listings
- `GET /listings` — query: `location, check_in, check_out, guests, min_price, max_price, property_type, amenities (csv of ids), instant_book, min_bathrooms, sw_lat, sw_lng, ne_lat, ne_lng, page, limit` -> paginated Listing[list]. When all four bounds are given the map viewport is the search area and `location` is ignored ("Homes in map area").
- `GET /listings/map` — same filters -> `[{ id, latitude, longitude, price_per_night, city }]`, up to 400 pins for everything in view (the paged search only returns one page; the map shows a price on every home).
- `GET /listings/featured` -> `[{ title: "Popular homes in Paris", city, items: Listing[list][] }]` — homepage carousel rows, grouped by city
- `GET /listings/{id}` -> Listing[detail]
- `POST /listings` — auth (host) — body: title, description, property_type, bedrooms, beds, bathrooms, max_guests, price_per_night, cleaning_fee, service_fee_pct, address, city, state, country, latitude, longitude, amenity_ids[], photo_urls[]
- `PUT /listings/{id}` — auth (owner host)
- `DELETE /listings/{id}` — auth (owner host)
- `GET /listings/mine` — auth (host) -> Listing[] owned by current user
- `GET /listings/{id}/availability` -> `{blocked_dates: [...]}`

### Bookings
- `POST /bookings` — auth — body `{listing_id, check_in, check_out, guests_count}` -> Booking (409 if overlapping dates or guests > max_guests)
- `GET /bookings/mine` — auth -> Booking[] (guest's trips)
- `GET /bookings/listing/{listing_id}` — auth (owner host) -> Booking[] for that listing
- `DELETE /bookings/{id}` — auth (owner guest) — cancel

### Reviews
- `GET /listings/{id}/reviews` -> Review[]
- `POST /listings/{id}/reviews` — auth — body `{rating, comment}` — must have a past completed booking for that listing

### Wishlist
- `GET /wishlist` — auth -> Listing[list][]
- `POST /wishlist/{listing_id}` — auth -> `{ok: true}`
- `DELETE /wishlist/{listing_id}` — auth -> `{ok: true}`

### Host dashboard
- `GET /host/dashboard` — auth (host) -> `{ listings: [...with booking_count, revenue], upcoming_bookings: [...] }`

### Users
- `GET /users/{id}` -> public profile: `UserPublic + { trips, reviews_written, months_on_platform, reviews: [{id, rating, comment, created_at, subject_kind, subject_id, subject_title, subject_city}], listings: Listing[list][] }`

### Destinations (search autocomplete)
- `GET /destinations?q=&limit=` -> Destination[]
- `GET /destinations/nearest?lat=&lng=` -> `{ city, country, latitude, longitude, count, distance_km }` — the closest city with inventory, compared against every city (powers "Nearby").

Suggestions are derived from live inventory (distinct cities and neighbourhoods that
actually have listings), so a suggestion can never lead to an empty results page. With no
`q`, returns the biggest cities by listing count — used for the "Popular destinations"
chips on empty states. Matching is case-insensitive; a prefix match outranks a substring
match, and cities outrank neighbourhoods.

```
Destination = { kind: "city" | "neighborhood", label, sublabel, city, country,
                latitude, longitude, count }
```

## Property types
`entire_home | private_room | shared_room | hotel_room`

## Error shape
`{ detail: "message" }` with appropriate HTTP status (400/401/403/404/409).

### Experiences & Services
Both live in the `experiences` table; `kind` is `experience` or `service`.
- `GET /experiences/featured?kind=experience|service` -> `[{ title, key, items: ExperienceCard[] }]` (experiences grouped by city, services by category)
- `GET /experiences?kind=&location=&category=&date=&guests=&page=&limit=` -> paginated ExperienceCard[]
- `GET /experiences/categories?kind=` -> `["Photography", "Training", ...]`
- `GET /experiences/{id}` -> ExperienceDetail (`+ description, host, photos, reviews, availability: [{date, spots_left}]` for the next 30 days)
- `POST /experiences/{id}/bookings` — auth — `{date, guests_count}` -> ExperienceBooking (409 when the date lacks enough spots)
- `POST /experiences/{id}/reviews` — auth — `{rating, comment}`; requires an attended (past-dated) booking
- `GET /experiences/bookings/mine` — auth -> ExperienceBooking[]
- `DELETE /experiences/bookings/{id}` — auth — cancel

```
ExperienceCard = { id, kind, category, title, city, country, price_per_guest, price_unit ("guest"|"group"),
                   start_time ("3:00 PM" or ""), duration_minutes, max_guests, latitude, longitude,
                   cover_photo_url, rating_avg, review_count }
ExperienceBooking = { id, experience: ExperienceCard, date, guests_count, total_price, status, created_at }
```

## Notes on scale

The seeded database holds ~5,900 listings across ~610 cities, so the read endpoints are
written to keep their query count flat rather than proportional to the result set:

- `GET /listings` counts and pages in SQL; the `check_in`/`check_out` availability filter
  is a `NOT EXISTS` sub-query over confirmed bookings, using the half-open interval
  `[check_in, check_out)` — a stay that ends the day another begins does not clash.
- Listing and experience cards are serialized in batches: one `GROUP BY` for ratings and
  one `IN` query for wishlist state, regardless of how many cards are on the page.
- `GET /listings/featured` and `GET /experiences/featured` accept `?rows=` (default 12,
  max 40) and group in SQL, so they never build a row per city across the whole catalogue.
- `GET /destinations` aggregates with `GROUP BY` and pushes the text match into the query.

Destinations are keyed by city **and** country: two real cities are named Lagos, and the
sublabel is what tells them apart.

## Hosting ("Become a host" wizard + hosting dashboard)

Listings carry a `status` (`draft` | `published` | `unlisted`); only `published`
homes appear in search, the map, home-page rows, destinations and public
profiles. A draft or unlisted home returns 404 to everyone but its host.
Listing detail also exposes the wizard fields: `structure_type`,
`host_highlights`, `weekend_price`, `new_listing_discount`, `weekly_discount`,
`monthly_discount`, `guest_visibility`, `has_exterior_camera`,
`has_noise_monitor`, `has_weapons`, `wizard_step`.

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/listings/drafts` | host | Your unfinished drafts |
| POST | `/listings/drafts` | host | Create an empty draft (Airbnb's "Get started") |
| PATCH | `/listings/{id}/draft` | host | Save one wizard step — every field optional; `wizard_step` records where to resume; `clear_weekend_price: true` resets the weekend price |
| POST | `/listings/{id}/publish` | host | Publish; 400 lists what's missing (title, location, photo, price, description) |
| PATCH | `/listings/{id}/status` | host | `{status: "published" \| "unlisted"}` — list / unlist |
| GET | `/host/reservations` | host | Today's buckets: `checking_out`, `currently_hosting`, `arriving_soon`, `upcoming`, `pending_review`, plus `all` |
| GET | `/host/earnings?year=` | host | Paid vs upcoming payouts by month, summary tiles, transaction history (3% host fee on homes, 20% on experiences/services) |
| GET | `/host/insights` | host | Ratings + breakdown, Superhost progress, 30-day occupancy, per-listing performance, recent reviews |
| GET | `/host/calendar/{listing_id}?year=&month=` | host | One month of nights: price (weekend price on Fri/Sat), blocked, booked (+ guest name) |
| PUT | `/host/calendar/{listing_id}` | host | `{dates: [...], blocked?, price?, reset_price?}` — block/open nights, set or reset a custom price |
| GET | `/host/estimate?city=&lat=&lng=&bedrooms=&nights=&property_type=` | — | "Your home could make X": median nightly rate of comparable published homes nearby |

Host-blocked nights appear in `blocked_dates` on the listing and are refused by
`POST /bookings` with 409, like any overlap.

### Pricing a stay

`GET /listings/{id}/quote?check_in=&check_out=` returns what a specific stay
costs, and is what both the booking widget and the checkout page display:

```jsonc
{
  "nights": 3,
  "rates": [120.0, 120.0, 80.0],   // one per night, in order
  "avg_nightly": 106.67,
  "nightly_subtotal": 320.0,
  "discount_label": "Weekly stay discount",
  "discount_rate": 0.1,
  "discount_amount": 32.0,
  "subtotal": 288.0,               // after the discount — fees are charged on this
  "cleaning_fee": 30.0,
  "service_fee": 34.56,
  "total": 352.56,
  "available": true,
  "unavailable_reason": ""
}
```

A night is priced by the most specific rule that applies: a price the host set
on that date in their calendar, then the weekend rate (Friday and Saturday),
then the listing's base rate. One discount applies, never two — the largest of
the monthly (28+ nights), weekly (7+) and new-listing (first 3 bookings)
candidates. `POST /bookings` prices the stay through the same function, so a
guest is charged exactly what they were quoted.

Schema changes are additive and applied on start-up (`app/migrate.py` adds
missing columns to the shipped SQLite database); a new
`listing_calendar_days` table holds calendar overrides.
